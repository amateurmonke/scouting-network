# Scouting Network

## Overview
Scouting Network is a machine learning-based web application that helps analyze football players and categorize them into clusters based on their performance metrics. The app allows users to enter a player's name and find similar players based on predefined statistical attributes.

## Usage
1. Visit https://scoutingnetwork.streamlit.app/
2. Enter a player's name. Enter their full name, with accents if any (Say, Martin Ã˜degaard instead of just entering Odegaard). Refer to the dataset in this repository for players.

## Future Improvements
- Classification of players using more advanced metrics
- Filtering of results
- Visualizations
